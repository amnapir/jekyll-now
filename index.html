        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Welcome! I’m Amna Pir Muhammad. I am a Ph.D. Student at the Chalmers University of Gothenburg working with Professor Eric Knauss and Jonas Bargman. I am a researcher on a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Action Innovative Training Network project aiming to enable the rapid and reliable development of safe and user-centered automated vehicles (AVs) for urban environments. My particular focus is investigating how to bring HF knowledge to AV developers. Previously, I specialized in Software Engineering and was working as a lecturer at the Comsats University of Islamabad.</p>
        <p>My current interests are in autonomous vehicle development(AVs), human factors(HF), large-scale agile development, and requirements engineering(RE). I’m passionate about shaping the relationship between humans and artificial intelligence (AI) based autonomous system.</p>
